# Some Important points about tabasco

- One of the main strengths of TABASCO is that it does not
  require training a machine learning model from the scratch using huge amounts of project-related labeled data. As a result,
  it can be directly used by a requirements engineer or a business analyst or a project manager for identifying potentially
  ambiguous nouns present in the software requirements or other project-related documents.
