I am working on a web project. The project has a frontend and a backend. The project's frontend will be in Next.js and the backend is in fastapi which I am currently working on first.

Now, My app is also non-authentication based app. Like you must have seen those websites which are processing based, like you go on website you do something like convert pdf to md, video compressor, image compressor in which the server has no database and does the thing on the server storage itself.

Now in my app, I am doing something similar, I am prompting user to upload a pdf or txt file and then first give them list of top n nouns with frequency. Then when the user chooses a noun and tells me another parameter then I give user the results on that noun which include finding intra-domain ambiguity using machine learning clustering and bert model uncased. I mean you got the idea that I don't intend to store anything on the server.

Now, I don't get it how I can make such a system and tackle problems of state, like suppose user refreshes in between a process, and then he again have to start from the start to upload the pdf.

Also, the thing is when someone uploads a pdf, do I need to save the pdf on the server storage or I can just convert the pdf into txt file first and then save it on the server. But again you gonna have to tell me a method to manage the refresh problem since we have no authentication.

And also hey once the user generates final summary and other reports and closes the server, maybe there should be a time after which the files should be automatically cleaned up from the server.

Also in case, is it possible to like take uploaded pdf file from user and then convert it to txt and then save it into user client's web browser storage and when everytime user sends something, we read it, also hey by this i got idea of solving the refreshing problem i.e. by using a session token like generate token as soon as user uploads a file and then that token will have an expiry time, and after that the user cannot send requests and the file gets deleted also. Please read all things carefully and address solutions to all the problems stated above.
